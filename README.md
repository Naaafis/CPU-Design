# CPU-Design

various lab assignments each assesing a section of CPU design. Builds up from ALU and ends with fully pipelined CPU that can adjust to flaws in instructions.

#
Started with just functional ALU.

Then built Functional datapath that propagates data through registers that are D-flip flops. Able to decode 32-bit instruction.

Made single cycle CPU that was capable of handling 32 bit instructions, including jump and branching as well as load words and store words.

Harazr detection and Data forwarding implemented in final lab.
